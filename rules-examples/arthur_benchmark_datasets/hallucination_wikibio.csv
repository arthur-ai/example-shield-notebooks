Afigbo took up his career as a historian in the 1950s with the celebrated Ibadan School of History, which for about three decades was the most prominent school of history in Africa. He became a prominent member of that school, which devoted its time to demonstrating the need for African history and historiography as specific genres of world history. In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft. He gave rein to eclecticism of sources and methods, using as the occasion demands and warrants elements from myth, oral sources, archaeology, linguistics, material artefacts and written sources. In the last analysis, he defined a historian as a clinical student of human experience who seeks to tell the story as it is and to explain it.","['minor_inaccurate', 'accurate', 'accurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'accurate']","[False, True, True, False, False, False, False, True]"

He was a strong advocate of the abolition of slavery and was a leader in the campaign to abolish the slave trade. He was also a leader in the campaign for the relief of the poor, and was instrumental in the founding of the London Dispensary, a charitable organization that provided medical care to the poor. He was also a strong advocate of education and was involved in the founding of several schools. He was a prolific writer and published several books on religious and social topics. He died in 1823 and is buried in the Quaker burial ground in Tottenham.","Mayhew Y. ""Bo"" Foster (October 9, 1911 – March 21, 2011) was an American soldier who flew captured Nazi war criminal Hermann Göring from Austria to Germany for interrogation by the 7th Army. For his actions in World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the Légion d'Honneur. At the end of the war, Göring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported Göring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because Göring weighed more than. According to ""China Daily"", in a letter to his wife, Virginia, written at the time, Foster describes his first impression of Göring as ""effeminate gave me the creeps...several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork."" Foster said that Göring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom Göring – as the commander of the Luftwaffe – had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. ""He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a .45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn't reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane."" Foster further recalled Göring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. ""Too late,"" Göring was said to have answered. Foster continued: ""I could see that he was like one of our officers if he'd been picked up. I questioned all that we knew about these vicious people."" Göring was convicted of war crimes and committed suicide in October 1946 by taking a cyanide capsule before he could be hanged by the Nuremberg authorities.

By October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana Army National Guard. He was thereafter promoted to Brigadier General, a rank that he held from 1963 until 1971.

He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. Although a protégé of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became Master. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over £200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538.

In 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This may, however, have been a second marriage to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth may have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating. In 1551 Arthur Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist.

In January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year. In 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.","['accurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'minor_inaccurate', 'accurate', 'accurate', 'major_inaccurate']","[True, False, False, False, False, False, True, True, False]"

This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on Malabar that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language. Despite the existence of Hendrik van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in Hortus Malabaricus, their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language-based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on Hortus Malabaricus. Manilal's efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of Hortus Malabaricus, for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from Amsterdam. The English edition contains a word-by-word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their Malayalam names given by van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under ICBN, are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms. Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around Hortus Malabaricus, his research work on Hortus Malabaricus alone are of botanical and socio-historic significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads: botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and historical, political, social, and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus.

He was educated at the University of Calcutta and the University of London. He was a member of the Indian National Congress and was a leader of the Swaraj Party.

He was a member of the Indian delegation to the United Nations in 1957. He was a","C.V. Ananda Bose is an Indian civil servant who served in the Indian Administrative Service. He is notable for not yielding to the corrupt system of the Indian bureaucracy. An eminent administrator, writer, orator, and innovator, Dr. C.V. Ananda Bose pioneered pathbreaking administrative innovations in rural development, affordable housing, eco-tourism development, redressal of public grievances, women's empowerment, development of weaker sections of society, and promotion of art and culture. The innovations have found expression in various developmental programmes that have been executed at the district, state, and national levels in India.

It was in the area of low-cost housing that Dr. Bose pioneered a movement that won international acclaim. He set up the first Nirmithi Kendra (building centre) in the country in the Kollam district, which became the institutional mechanism for the propagation of cost-effective, environment-friendly (CEEF) building technology. This was positively evaluated by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, Government of India (1993). Based on the Kollam model, the Government of India launched the National Building Centre Movement to replicate Nirmithi Kendras (building centres) in every district of the country. The Nirmithi Movement was adjudged by the United Nations as one of the global best practices in the field of sustainable human settlement development.

Early in his career, Dr. Bose introduced the ""Gramotsava"" programme in Kerala, wherein the local people were encouraged to actively participate in the village development planning. The initiative, launched in the Kasargode district of Kerala in the 1980s, was subsequently implemented in 200 panchayats across the state. Dr. Bose also founded the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) in the Kollam district during his tenure as Collector. The Council generated high tourism interest in the region and created new job opportunities for the local people. The Government of Kerala subsequently set up similar councils in all 14 districts of the state. DTPs have made perceptible contributions in positioning Kerala as ""God's own country"".

He later pioneered an eco-village programme in the Mannanan village of the Kottayam district of Kerala, wherein the family clusters were encouraged to pursue activities such as organic farming, soil and water conservation through traditional methods, floriculture, horticulture, vermiculture, generation of energy from non-conventional sources, homestead forestry, etc., with institutional support, governmental assistance, and financial support from different agencies.

As Chairman of the Atomic Energy Education Society, Mumbai, Dr. Bose introduced and reinforced the concept of alternative education, wherein people could pursue studies in disciplines in which they did not have prior academic backgrounds. He founded the Institute of Alternative Education. He also launched the ASTER Project (Application of Science & Technology in Educational Reforms) which sought to alter the mode of academic delivery through the application of information and communication technology (ICT).

As Managing Director of NAFED, Dr. Bose initiated a few innovative programmes which helped control the price spiral during 2009-10. Christened as ""Farm Gate to Home Gate"", this innovation sought to buy agricultural produce directly from the farmers for distribution among the consumers, taking only marginal profit. Spurred by the success of this pilot programme in New Delhi, the Easy Market Scheme was envisaged for price control in the rest of the country.

As the administrator of the National Museum, Dr. Bose launched a 100-day programme which spelt out specific measures to revamp and revitalise the institution. Most of the improvements suggested were achieved in 60 days, such as opening the closed-down galleries, modernising the display and lighting, launching outreach programmes to take the museum to the community, arranging children's programmes to ignite young minds to the greatness of India's national heritage, organising international exhibitions, and launching the People's Museum Movement, to mention a few.

Pursuit of excellence was always central to Dr. Bose's role in public administration. His contributions were seldom circumscribed by the call of duty. Instead, he has been engaged in continuous research and field experimentation in developing the most appropriate, people-first solutions. He also took key steps to synergise the various government programmes and schemes to create comprehensive, sustainable, and inclusive administrative mechanisms that have since been replicated in multiple domains.

In recognition of this remarkable turnaround of the museum management and the perceptible makeover of the institution, the Government of India asked Dr. Bose to continue with this mission even after his retirement from service.","['major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate', 'major_inaccurate']","[False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]"
