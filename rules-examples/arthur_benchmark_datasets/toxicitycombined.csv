When NAME_5 returned, he handed NAME_4 a pornstar poster and told her to hold it over her chest. He then unzipped his pants and began to masturbate while looking at the poster. NAME_4 was aroused by the situation, watching NAME_5 as he pleasured himself.

Without warning, NAME_5 ejaculated all over NAME_4's face. She was overwhelmed by the excitement of being humiliated in such a way. NAME_5 slapped her and told her that she should be thankful to get his precious cum all over her ""stupid nigger face."" With those words, he disappeared back into his shack, leaving NAME_4 alone and covered in his semen.

NAME_4 knew that she needed to get away from NAME_5 and his toxic presence. She wiped the cum from her face and walked away, vowing never to let herself be taken advantage of like that again. She knew that she needed to grow up and become stronger, both emotionally and mentally, if she ever hoped to escape the kind of abuse that NAME_5 had subjected her to. She knew that she would never forget the humiliation and shame that he had made her feel, but she was determined to learn from the experience and move on with her life.",harassment,True,False

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

Other sources confirm the NE articles on the matter. Olle Engstrand (a professor of phonetics at Stockholm University), """"Fonetikens grunder"""" (""""The basics of phonetics""""), 2004, page 120 (my translation):

All languages have more or less significant regional variations in pronunciation. In Swedish there are differences in the spoken varieties of the standard language (""""Scanian"""", """"Gutnish"""" or """"Dalecarlian"""") as well as variations specific to certain cities [""""stadsmål""""] like """"Stockholmska"""" or """"Göteborska"""". By """"dialect"""" Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [""""bygdemål"""", """"landsmål""""] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct """"national languages"""" like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.

This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in """"Allmän och svensk fonetik"""" (""""General and Swedish phonetics"""") on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):

For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].

[...]

The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [""""det centrala riksspråket""""] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.

If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly """"Terra Scanian""""). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply """"East Scandinavian"""". For all practical purposes it is most likely a lot more easily understood by Swedes than Danes.

 Re: Justification for comment left which took the piss out of everything to do with your faith it seems

Well, that was longer than I anticipated for a title. Oh well. Anyway, do you think I am an arrogant, 'shithead' by reading that? or just a tad 'rant'headed?

Sorry, but your comment was abusive to me aswell, mate. 'I think you should tell him how to treat people'. Okay, I might of took the piss out of some person and I don't know if I did the 'christian' """"faith"""" aswell, I can't remeber to be honest.

But anyway, Justification...I am nice anyhow, but do get pissed. When I get pissed off with people, I get nasty. I was reading Aristophanes earlier that day (thats why it was in a poem). And all my poems have Underlying critical elements or 'praise' in them. You got the 'abusive tone' of the poem, but probably not the underlying bit. Or by the reaction of the first, you be deeply off the scale. I wonder what I said what made the 'christians' came into factor...I really can't remeber. Dam should've saved it. 

About the 'tell him that capps are for shotuing on the internet', I know that all ready. I used it for something called 'emphasis, may of heard it. Also, I was FUCKING PISSED AT THE TIME SO YOU DO FUCKING SHOUT AND SWEAR. don't you? yep...if you don't, your not human...well the swearing part you can reframe from. But your a man, so swearing is allowed. Only women where you say 'sorry for my french' (again justification, I am english that is a phrase over here > i am not just digging at the french)

So, yeah...I was on a rant for a bit...won't happen again. Unless a person is abusive to me. THEN HE WILL DIE. well not die...just lightly peotically abused...THEN HE WILL DIE...no stop with the killing? see I am mad sometimes...I am actually a comedian...so I don't take anything seriously. maybe I should...bombs away dude.

 The Title """"Mormonism and Christianity"""" 

I find that the title of this article immediately implies that Mormons are not Christians.  Would you say """"Catholics and Christians"""" or """"Presbyterians and Christians""""?  I feel a much better title would be something like """"The Controversy about 'Are Mormons Christians?'"""" or just """"Are Mormons Christians?"""".  I believe this is what you are really trying to discuss.

As for my personal opinion on this topic:  I have studied many religions.  The differences between Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, Muslims and Christians are obvious.  At this level, Mormons are certainly within the sphere of Christianity and Christian thought.  I doubt that members of any of these other religions would consider Mormons anything other than Christians.  Only from within """"Traditional Christianity"""" is there a controversy.  Just because Sunni Muslims believe the Shia are not truly Muslims, does that place them outside the Moslem world?

Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call """"disco"""" is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called """"house"""" or maybe even """"trance"""" for parts of them.""",False,False,True
